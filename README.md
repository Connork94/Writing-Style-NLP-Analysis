## Quick Start
Download the files and open in the IDE of your choice.

You will need to extract the RAR file with the texts into the project directory.

The file Analysis Function Hyphenated Adj.py is a variation of the normal Analysis Function code. Hyphenated adjectives required a slightly different approach to process.
